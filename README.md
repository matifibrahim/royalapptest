To clone and serve a Laravel project, you'll need to follow these steps:

## Prerequisites:

Make sure you have PHP and Composer installed on your system.
- You can download PHP from the official website (https://www.php.net/downloads.php) and Composer from (https://getcomposer.org/).
- Additionally, ensure that you have a web server (like Apache or Nginx) and a database server (like MySQL) set up on your machine or hosting environment.
- Must have php version 7.3 to 8.0",

## Clone the Project:

Open a terminal or command prompt.
Navigate to the directory where you want to store the Laravel project.
Clone the Laravel project repository using Git by running the following command:
bash

### git clone [https://github.com/matifibrahim/royalapptest]

Install Dependencies:

- Change into the project directory:

### cd <project_folder_name>

- Install the project dependencies using Composer:

### composer install

## Configure Environment:

- Create a copy of the .env.example file and rename it to .env:
### cp .env.example .env

Generate the application key, which is needed for encryption and other secure operations:

### php artisan key:generate

You can use the built-in development server to serve the Laravel application. In the project directory, run:

### php artisan serve

## Access the Application:

By default, the Laravel development server runs on http://localhost:8000. Open your web browser and enter this URL to access your Laravel application.

Now your Laravel project should be up and running! If you are deploying the project to a production server, you may need to configure a web server like Apache or Nginx to serve the application and set up additional configurations for security and performance. But for local development, the built-in development server should suffice.
